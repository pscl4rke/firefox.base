Modern web browsers are terribly confused.  They are so focused upon
doing everything through one everlasting session that they completely
overlook how much cleaner everything runs if sessions are disposable.
Launching a new session for every task in its own independent window
makes interacting with the modern web much more predictable and puts
the user back in control.

This project provides a base template for a Firefox profile.  It's
set to my own preferences, but you can copy the idea for yourselves.
This is rarely updated, but does get copied every time I want to do
a bit of web browsing.
